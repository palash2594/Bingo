# Bingo

Bingo is a game of chance in which each player matches numbers printed in different arrangements on 5Ã—5 cards with the numbers the game host draws at random, marking the selected numbers with tiles. When a player finds the selected numbers are arranged on their card in a row, they call out "Bingo!" to alert all participants to a winning card.
